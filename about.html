        The students from diverse background are selected through a nationwide
        written test followed by an interview. The posh campus, situated in
        southern suburb of national capital provides excellent teaching and
        learning environment to the students. Most of the classrooms are fitted
        with modern audio visual aids. The undergraduate curriculum of the
        Department includes a foundation of mathematics, physics, chemistry,
        environment, humanities, and electrical engineering. Engineering courses
        in fundamental areas constitute much of the remaining curriculum. A few
        technical electives allow the undergraduate student to specialize
        somewhat or to pursue broader understanding. In addition, the students
        develop experiment conducting skill by performing experiments in 20
        different laboratories in the department. Department also supports
        workshop to students of all branches of Engineering.
